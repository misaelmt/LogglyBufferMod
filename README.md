# LogglyBufferMod
[Loggly.com](https://www.loggly.com/ "loggly.com") module for Corona SDK. 
It uses my [RequestBuffer](https://github.com/misaelmt/RequestBuffer "RequestBuffer") to reduce server load and data usage. 
By default the buffer flushes every 4 requests, but you can adjust that to your needs.
